itc.cli
=======

iTunesConnect command line interface

This script pursues several goals. First of all I've always wanted to have a simple and nice cli for iTunesConnect, so here's my attempt to create one.
Second goal is to improve my python skills :). This is my first program on python, so please do not judge strictly. If you see that you know how to improve this script (and my python skills :)), please, do not hesitate to send a pull request.

As this script is under heavy development and it's not even in pre-pre-alpha state, there's nothing in 'master' branch. Look into 'develop'.
